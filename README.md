# Apple-Finder
This app was my AP Computer Science Principles final, developed in MIT App Inventor. It is called "Apple Finder", and its main use it to find and select your own personal apple. The user would instert their preferences into some sliders (i.e. sweetness, crispness, tartness), and the algorithm would find their perfect apple.
