# Apple-Finder
This app was my AP Computer Science Principles final, developed in MIT App Inventor. It is call "Apple Finder", and its main use it to find and select your own personal apple. You would instert your preferences into some sliders (i.e. sweetness, crispness, tartness), and the algorithm would find your perfect apple.
